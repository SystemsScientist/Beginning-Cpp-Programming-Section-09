Section 09: Infinite Loops
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infinite Loops

	- Loops when condition expression always evaluate to true

	- Usually this is unintended and a programmer error

	- Sometimes programmers use infinite loops and include
	  and break statements in the body to control them

	- Sometimes infinite loops are exactly what we need
	  
		+ Event loop in an event-driven program
	
		+ Operating system


Example 1

	for (;;)
		cout << "This will print forever" << endl;


Example 2

	while (true)
		cout << "This will print forever" << endl;


Example 3

	do {
		cout << "This will print forever" << endl;
	} while (true);


Example 4

	while (true) {
		char again;
		cout << "Do you want to loop again? (Y/N): ";
		cin >> again;

		if (again == 'N' || again == 'n')
			break;
	}
