Section 09: Looping
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iteration

	- The third basic building block of programming

		+ sequence, selection, iteration

	- Iteration or repetition

	- Allows the execution of a statement or block
	  of statements repeatedly

	- Loops are made up of a loop condition and the
	  body which contains the statements to repeat


Some Typical use-cases

	Execute a loop:

		+ a specific number of times

		+ for each element in a collection

		+ while a specific condition remains 
		  true

		+ until a specific condition becomes
		  false

		+ until we reach the end of some input
		  stream

		+ forever (ex: operating systems)

		+ many, many more


C++ Looping Constructs

	- for loop

		+ iterate a specific number of times

	- Range-based for loop

		+ one iteration for each element in a
		  range or collection

	- while loop

		+ iterate while a condition remains
		  true

		+ stop when the condition becomes 
		  false

		+ check the condition at the beginning
		  of every iteration

	- do-while loop
			
		+ iterate while a condition remains
		  true

		+ stop when the condition becomes
		  false

		+ check the condition at the end of
		  every iteration
